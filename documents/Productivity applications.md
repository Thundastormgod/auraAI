Of course. You've landed on some powerful concepts for a productivity app. Let's break down the best user-required features right now, analyze your specific ideas, and explore how AI can elevate them from good to game-changing.

### **The Best User-Required Features in Productivity Apps (Right Now)**

Based on current trends and user demand, here are the top features users expect and value in modern productivity apps:

* **Seamless Integration and Centralisation:** Users are battling app fatigue. The most successful productivity tools act as a central hub. They integrate smoothly with calendars (like Google Calendar and Outlook), communication platforms (like Slack and Teams), and cloud storage (like Dropbox and Google Drive). This creates a single source of truth and reduces the friction of switching between multiple applications.  
* **Flexible and Adaptable Views:** The "one-size-fits-all" approach is dead. Users demand the ability to visualise their tasks and projects in multiple ways. The most popular apps, like Notion, ClickUp, and Asana, offer a variety of views, including:  
  * **Kanban boards:** For a visual workflow.  
  * **Lists:** For straightforward task management.  
  * **Calendar views:** For time-based planning.  
  * **Gantt charts/Timelines:** For understanding project dependencies and duration.  
* **AI-Powered Assistance:** Artificial intelligence is no longer a gimmick; it's a core feature. Users are looking for AI that genuinely saves them time and mental energy. The most valuable AI features include:  
  * **Smart Scheduling:** AI that suggests optimal times for tasks based on your schedule and priorities.  
  * **Natural Language Processing:** The ability to add tasks and set deadlines by simply typing or speaking in plain language (e.g., "Remind me to finish the report by Friday at 5 pm").  
  * **Summarisation and Action Item Extraction:** AI that can read through notes or meeting transcripts and pull out key takeaways and to-do items.  
  * **Automated Workflows:** AI that can automate repetitive tasks based on predefined triggers (e.g., when a task is marked "complete," a notification is sent to a specific person).  
* **Effortless Collaboration:** For both professional and personal projects, the ability to work with others is crucial. This includes features like:  
  * **Task assignment and real-time updates.**  
  * **In-app comments and discussions.**  
  * **Shared workspaces and projects.**

### **Analysis of Your Feature Ideas**

Your ideas tap into some powerful psychological drivers of productivity. Here's a detailed look at each one:

#### **1\. Milestones for the User**

**This is an excellent and highly sought-after feature.**

* **Why it works:** Large goals can be overwhelming, leading to procrastination. Breaking them down into smaller, achievable milestones provides a clear roadmap and a sense of progress. Each completed milestone delivers a dopamine hit, which boosts motivation and keeps the user engaged.  
* **Current Market:** This is a standard and essential feature in project management tools like Asana, Trello, and ClickUp. For personal productivity, it's a key differentiator that can elevate a simple to-do list into a powerful goal-tracking system.  
* **AI Enhancement:**  
  * **Automated Milestone Suggestion:** An AI agent could analyze a user's goal (e.g., "launch a new website") and automatically suggest logical milestones (e.g., "1. Finalise design mockups," "2. Develop front-end," "3. Conduct user testing," "4. Deploy").  
  * **Progress Visualisation:** AI can create dynamic and visually appealing progress reports and charts based on milestone completion, making the user's achievements feel more tangible.

#### **2\. Alarms or Timing Constraints**

**This is a strong concept, but with important nuances.**

* **Why it works:** This feature leverages two powerful productivity techniques:  
  * **Timeboxing/The Pomodoro Technique:** Allocating a fixed time period to a single task creates a sense of urgency and helps to combat perfectionism and distraction.  
  * **Parkinson's Law:** The idea that "work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion." By setting a timer, you constrain the time available, forcing more focused effort.  
* **Current Market:** Simple alarms and reminders are standard. Pomodoro timers are also a popular feature in many focus-oriented apps (like Forest). However, a hard "timer to make sure the task is done" can be a double-edged sword. For some, it's motivating; for others, it can induce anxiety and a feeling of being rushed, which can stifle creativity.  
* **AI Enhancement:**  
  * **Adaptive Timing:** An AI agent could learn a user's work patterns and suggest optimal work and break intervals. For example, it might notice you're most focused in 45-minute bursts and suggest that as your default timer.  
  * **Intelligent Alarms:** Instead of just a jarring alarm, the AI could provide context-aware notifications. For example, "You have 10 minutes left on your 'drafting report' task. It's a good time to start summarising your key points."

#### **3\. Task Validation (Accountability Partner)**

**This is an incredibly powerful and growing feature area.**

* **Why it works:** This taps into the psychology of social accountability. Studies have shown that you are significantly more likely to achieve a goal if you've committed to it with another person. The desire not to let someone down is a potent motivator.  
* **Current Market:** This is a burgeoning category in productivity. Apps like FocusMate (which pairs you with a live, silent video partner for a work session) and Tability (for team goal tracking) are built entirely around this concept. Your idea of requiring validation for a task to be marked as complete is a strong one.  
* **AI Enhancement:**  
  * **AI as the Accountability Partner:** For users who don't want a human partner, an AI agent could fill this role. It could send check-in messages ("How is the 'research competitors' task coming along?") and ask for proof of completion.  
  * **AI-Powered Validation:** This is where it gets truly innovative. You could require the user to upload evidence of task completion (e.g., a photo of a cleaned room, a screenshot of a sent email, a document). An AI agent could then perform a basic validation check on this evidence. For example, it could use optical character recognition (OCR) to confirm a document contains certain keywords or image recognition to identify objects. This would be a groundbreaking feature.

### **Recommendation**

Your ideas are not just good; they align perfectly with the direction the most innovative productivity apps are heading. By combining the established power of **milestones**, the focused intensity of **timing constraints**, and the profound motivational impact of an **accountability partner**, you have the blueprint for a very compelling product.

The key to success will be in the execution. And by thoughtfully integrating **AI agents** into every facet of these features—from suggesting milestones to acting as an intelligent accountability partner—you can create a productivity tool that is not only useful but feels truly personalised and supportive.

Of course. Let's combine these powerful features into a cohesive application concept. We will build this with all the considerations and nuances in mind to create a tool that feels less like a taskmaster and more like a true partner in achievement.

Here is the concept for your new application.

---

### **Introducing Aura: Your AI Achievement Ally**

**Brand Philosophy:** Aura isn't just about checking boxes. It's about building positive momentum and fostering a healthy, sustainable relationship with your goals. It’s the supportive partner that helps you climb your mountains, one milestone at a time, celebrating your progress and providing intelligent support when you need it most.

---

### **The Core User Experience: The "Aura Flow"**

Aura is designed around a single, intuitive workflow, from defining a major goal to celebrating its completion.

1. **Define Your Ascent:** A user doesn't just add a "goal"; they define an **Ascent**. This is a major objective they want to achieve (e.g., "Run a 10k," "Launch my online store," "Write my dissertation").  
2. **AI Milestone Mapping:** The moment the user defines their Ascent, **Aura, the AI Ally,** instantly gets to work. Using natural language processing, it analyzes the goal and proposes a logical, step-by-step milestone map.  
   * *User Control:* The user has full control to accept, reject, modify, or add to these AI-suggested milestones. The AI provides the template; the user provides the final approval.  
3. **Initiate a Focus Sprint:** For each milestone, the user initiates a **Focus Sprint**. This is where they commit to a block of focused work. This feature directly incorporates your idea for timing constraints, but with flexibility.  
4. **Complete the Validation Pact:** Once the work is done, the task isn't just "checked off." The user fulfills a **Validation Pact**—a commitment they make to ensure the task is truly complete, fostering accountability.  
5. **Build Momentum:** With each validated milestone, the user sees their Ascent progress bar fill. The app uses positive reinforcement and visual rewards to make progress feel tangible and motivating.

---

### **Detailed Feature Implementation**

Here’s how each core feature is built into Aura with our considerations in place:

#### **1\. The Ascent Hub & AI Milestone Planner**

This is the main dashboard. It displays all of the user's "Ascents" with beautiful, minimalist progress bars. When a user creates an Ascent, the AI asks clarifying questions to generate better milestones.

* **Example:**  
  * **User:** "I want to learn how to cook."  
  * **Aura AI:** "That's a fantastic Ascent\! To help map this out, are you more interested in a specific cuisine (like Italian or Thai), or general skills like knife work and baking basics?"  
  * Based on the answer, it generates milestones like "Master basic knife skills," "Learn to make five foundational sauces," and "Successfully cook a three-course meal."

#### **2\. The Focus Sprint Timer (Your "Alarms & Timing Constraints" Idea)**

This feature is designed for user choice to prevent anxiety while still encouraging focus. When a user starts a Focus Sprint on a task, they can choose from several modes:

* **Pomodoro Mode:** A classic 25-minute work sprint followed by a 5-minute break.  
* **Timebox Mode:** The user sets a specific amount of time they want to dedicate to the task. An alarm will gently notify them when the time is up.  
* **Flow State Mode (Premium Feature):** No timer is displayed. The user simply tells Aura when they start and stop. The AI works in the background, learning the user's optimal focus durations and providing insights later ("You did your deepest work yesterday in a 48-minute session").

#### **3\. The Validation Pact System (Your "Accountability Partner" Idea)**

This is Aura's most powerful feature. To mark a milestone complete, the user must validate it. They choose the type of pact when setting up the milestone, providing flexibility and control.

* **Tier 1: Personal Validation (Self-Reflection):** The user is presented with a "Mindful Check-in." Aura asks, "Did you complete this to a standard you are proud of? What is one thing you learned or achieved?" This encourages honest self-assessment rather than mindless box-checking.  
* **Tier 2: AI-Assisted Validation (Proof of Work):** For tangible tasks, the user can have the AI validate their work. This is handled with absolute respect for privacy.  
  * **Example 1 (Writing):** User uploads a document. Aura's AI scans it (without storing it) to confirm a word count or check for the presence of key phrases.  
  * **Example 2 (Design):** User uploads an image. Aura's AI uses image recognition to confirm it's a new file and not a blank canvas.  
  * **Example 3 (Fitness):** User grants temporary access to their phone's health data, and Aura confirms a 2-mile run was completed.  
* **Tier 3: Ally Pact (Human Accountability):** The user designates a friend, mentor, or family member as their "Ally" for that specific Ascent. When a milestone is complete, the Ally receives a simple, non-intrusive notification (e.g., "Chris has marked 'Finish first draft' as complete. Send some encouragement\!"). For critical tasks, the user can require the Ally to hit a "Validate" button before the milestone is officially cleared.

---

### **Monetisation & Target Audience**

* **Target Audience:** Ambitious students, freelancers, creative professionals, entrepreneurs, and anyone working on long-term personal or professional goals that require self-motivation.  
* **Aura Free:**  
  * Up to 3 active "Ascents."  
  * AI Milestone planning.  
  * Standard Focus Sprint timers.  
  * Personal and Ally Pact validation only.  
* **Aura Ascent (Subscription: Monthly/Annual):**  
  * Unlimited active "Ascents."  
  * Advanced AI-Assisted Validation features.  
  * "Flow State" timer mode and detailed productivity analytics (e.g., "You're most productive between 9-11 AM on Tuesdays").  
  * Advanced reporting and progress tracking.  
  * Priority support.

By structuring the app this way, **Aura** becomes more than a tool—it's a partner that helps you strategise, focus, and prove your results to the most important person: yourself.

Excellent. You're focusing on what could be the most powerful and unique aspect of the application. The AI accountability partner is the key to preventing users from simply "checking a box" and ensuring genuine progress.

The **Aura** concept we just designed has this feature built-in as a cornerstone, called the **"AI-Assisted Validation"** within the Validation Pact system. Let's elaborate on exactly how this AI accountability partner would work to make sure the user actually did the task.

### **Aura's AI Accountability Partner in Action**

When a user sets up a milestone, they can choose to have their AI Ally validate it. This means that to mark the task as complete, the user must provide "Proof of Work." Aura's AI is designed to intelligently and securely analyze this proof.

Here are more detailed examples of how it would work for different types of tasks:

#### **For Digital & Creative Tasks:**

* **Task: "Write 1,000 words for my blog post."**  
  * **Validation Method:** The user uploads the document (e.g., a .docx or a Google Docs link with view access).  
  * **AI Action:** Aura's AI performs a quick, on-the-fly analysis. It doesn't read or store the content for privacy reasons. It simply checks the metadata and structure to confirm:  
    1. The document's word count is at or above 1,000.  
    2. The "last modified" date is today, proving it's new work.  
    3. It's not just gibberish (by checking for basic language structure).  
  * **Confirmation:** A message appears: "Validated\! Word count: 1,024. Great session\!"  
* **Task: "Code the user login feature."**  
  * **Validation Method:** The user connects their GitHub/GitLab account or uploads the relevant code files.  
  * **AI Action:** The AI partner scans the code for signs of meaningful activity. It can check:  
    1. The number of new lines of code committed.  
    2. The presence of key functions or syntax related to the task (e.g., function userLogin(), class Authentication).  
    3. The commit messages to ensure they are relevant.  
  * **Confirmation:** "Validated\! I can see the new authentication functions. Solid progress."

#### **For Physical & Real-World Tasks:**

* **Task: "Clean my home office."**  
  * **Validation Method:** The user takes a "before" and "after" photo within the Aura app.  
  * **AI Action:** The AI uses computer vision to analyze the two images. It looks for changes in object detection, clutter levels, and surface clarity.  
  * **Confirmation:** "Validated\! What a transformation. It looks much more organized."  
* **Task: "Go for a 30-minute run."**  
  * **Validation Method:** The user grants one-time access to their phone's fitness data (like Apple Health or Google Fit) for that specific activity.  
  * **AI Action:** Aura reads only the most recent workout data, confirms a new activity was logged that meets the duration and category (e.g., "Outdoor Run"), and then immediately discards the access.  
  * **Confirmation:** "Validated\! 32-minute run complete. Awesome work\!"  
* **Task: "Read one chapter of a book."**  
  * **Validation Method:** After reading, the user is prompted by the AI: "To validate this, please write 3-4 bullet points summarising the chapter."  
  * **AI Action:** The AI analyzes the user's input to ensure it's coherent, relevant, and not just random words. It's checking for engagement, not for a "correct" answer.  
  * **Confirmation:** "Validated\! It sounds like you got a lot out of that chapter."

### **Why this is a Game-Changer**

This AI accountability system is what elevates Aura from a simple task manager to a true achievement partner. It solves the universal problem of self-deception in productivity. By creating a frictionless, private, and intelligent method of validation, you:

* **Build Trust:** The user builds trust in their own ability to follow through.  
* **Generate Real Momentum:** Every completed task is a genuine victory, making the feeling of progress authentic and much more motivating.  
* **Provide a Unique Selling Point:** No other app offers this level of intelligent, private, and versatile accountability.

This feature is precisely what you need to make the app stand out and deliver on its promise of being an effective productivity partner. It's already a core part of the Aura design.

Of course. Given the rapid evolution of AI and app capabilities, especially as we're now in mid-2025, we can create a truly cutting-edge feature set for "Aura."

The core essence of Aura is: **"A supportive AI partner that turns intentions into achievements through validated action."** It's not just a list-keeper; it's a coach, a cheerleader, and a gentle source of accountability.

Here is a complete breakdown of Aura's features, followed by a list of new, synergistic features you could include to make it a market leader.

---

### **Aura: Complete Feature List**

This list expands on our previous discussion to create a comprehensive, robust application.

#### **I. Core Experience: The Ascent™ Framework**

* **The Ascent Hub:** The main dashboard. A clean, visual representation of all major goals ("Ascents"). Each Ascent has its own progress bar, showing milestone completion and a projected "summit date" calculated by the AI.  
* **AI Milestone Architect:**  
  * **Natural Language Input:** Users define an Ascent in plain English (e.g., "Get my YouTube channel to 1000 subscribers").  
  * **AI-Generated Roadmap:** Aura's AI instantly creates a logical, editable sequence of milestones (e.g., "1. Define Channel Niche," "2. Purchase Equipment," "3. Film & Edit First 5 Videos," "4. Create Upload Schedule," "5. Promote on Social Media").  
  * **Sub-Task Generation:** Users can ask the AI to break down any milestone into smaller, more manageable sub-tasks.

#### **II. The Focus Sprint™ System**

This is the system for dedicated, timed work sessions.

* **Multi-Mode Timer:**  
  * **Pomodoro Mode:** Classic work/break intervals.  
  * **Timebox Mode:** User sets a fixed duration for a task.  
  * **Flow State Mode (Premium):** An open-ended timer that tracks the session without a visible clock, reducing pressure.  
* **AI Focus Guard:**  
  * Connects to device settings to automatically enable "Do Not Disturb" during a Focus Sprint.  
  * Can provide gentle, on-screen nudges if the user navigates to pre-defined distracting apps ("Remember, you're on a Focus Sprint for your Ascent. Just 15 minutes to go\!").

#### **III. The Validation Pact™ System (AI Accountability)**

This is Aura's signature feature for ensuring tasks are actually completed.

* **Personal Validation:** A "Mindful Check-in" that asks the user to reflect on the completed task.  
* **AI-Assisted Validation:** The user provides "Proof of Work" for Aura's AI to analyse.  
  * **Document Analysis:** Confirms word count, keyword presence, or file creation date for writing/coding tasks.  
  * **Image Analysis:** Uses computer vision to detect changes in "before and after" photos (e.g., for cleaning or organising tasks).  
  * **Audio Analysis:** Can confirm a user has practised a musical instrument by detecting the specific sound for a set duration.  
  * **Location Confirmation:** Uses GPS to validate tasks like "Go to the gym" or "Visit the library."  
* **Ally Pact (Social Validation):** Allows a user to nominate a friend or mentor to verify task completion with a simple tap.

#### **IV. Momentum & Insights Dashboard**

This is where users see the results of their efforts and gain self-knowledge.

* **Personalised Analytics:** Visual charts showing the user's most productive days and times, the average duration of their focus sprints, and which types of tasks they complete fastest.  
* **"Aura Insights" (Premium):** The AI provides weekly performance summaries and observations. Examples:  
  * "I've noticed you complete creative milestones 20% faster in the mornings. You might want to schedule more of them then."  
  * "You haven't made progress on your 'Learn Spanish' Ascent in two weeks. Would you like me to suggest a smaller, 15-minute milestone to get you started again?"  
* **Gamification & Rewards:**  
  * Earn "Aura Points" for completing sprints and validating tasks.  
  * Unlock new visual themes, app icons, and celebratory animations.  
  * Achieve streaks for consecutive days of work.

### **New Synergistic Features to Include**

Based on Aura's core essence, here are other highly complementary features you could add to create an unbeatable productivity ecosystem.

#### **1\. The "Aura Zen" Wellness Integration**

* **Essence:** Acknowledges that productivity is impossible without well-being. Burnout is the enemy of achievement.  
* **Features:**  
  * **Pre-Sprint Meditations:** Before a Focus Sprint, Aura can offer a 1-2 minute guided mindfulness exercise to clear the user's mind.  
  * **AI Stress Detection (Wearable Integration):** With user permission, Aura can connect to smartwatches (Apple Watch, Fitbit, etc.). If it detects a sudden, sustained spike in heart rate during a Focus Sprint, it can gently suggest a break: "Your focus seems intense. Taking a 3-minute breather can actually improve your performance."  
  * **Post-Ascent Reflection:** After a major Ascent is completed, Aura guides the user through a journaling session to celebrate the achievement and prevent "post-goal depression."

#### **2\. The "Aura Vision" Goal Visualisation Hub**

* **Essence:** Connects the user's daily actions to their long-term vision and core motivations.  
* **Features:**  
  * **Digital Vision Board:** A dedicated space within the app where users can upload images, quotes, and notes that represent *why* they are pursuing their Ascents.  
  * **"Why" Reminders:** The user writes a short statement about their core motivation for each Ascent. Aura will randomly surface this reminder at the start of a Focus Sprint to reinforce their purpose. ("Starting a sprint for 'Complete financial model'. Remember why you're doing this: 'To achieve financial freedom and security for my family.'").

#### **3\. Advanced Social & Community Pacts**

* **Essence:** Leverages the power of positive social reinforcement and friendly competition.  
* **Features:**  
  * **Group Ascents:** Allow multiple users to tackle a shared goal (e.g., a study group working towards an exam, or a team launching a product). The hub shows individual contributions and overall progress.  
  * **Public Pacts (Opt-in):** For users who want maximum accountability, they can make an Ascent public. This creates a dedicated, shareable link where friends can see their progress and leave encouraging comments, which appear directly in the app.  
  * **Aura "Ally" Leaderboards:** A simple, anonymised leaderboard where users can see how their "Aura Points" or "Completed Milestones" stack up against other users in their city or country, fostering a sense of shared effort.

#### **4\. Deeper Smart Home & Device Integration**

* **Essence:** Makes Aura a central command centre for a user's "focus environment."  
* **Features:**  
  * **Focus Scene Activation:** When a user starts a Focus Sprint, Aura can send a signal (via IFTTT or Matter) to their smart home devices to trigger a pre-set "Focus Scene"—dimming the lights, playing a focus playlist on a smart speaker, and turning a smart plug on for their desk lamp.  
  * **Calendar Intelligence:** Aura doesn't just read your calendar; it interacts with it. It can find empty slots and suggest times for Focus Sprints. It can also automatically block out time in your public calendar when you commit to a sprint, preventing interruptions.  
  * **AI-Scribed Notes:** By integrating with transcription services, a user could have a meeting, and Aura's AI would analyse the transcript to automatically suggest new sub-tasks or milestones for relevant Ascents.

I can help you explore UI/UX ideas for Aura, including the intriguing concept of 3D views and physics. Let's break down how we can approach this.

## **Exploring UI/UX for Aura**

Aura's features suggest a need for a UI that's both intuitive and engaging, fostering focus and motivation.

### **Core Principles for Aura's UI/UX**

* **Clarity & Simplicity:** Despite the advanced features, the UI should never feel overwhelming. Information should be easily digestible.  
* **Motivation & Encouragement:** The design should subtly push users towards their goals, celebrating progress and offering gentle nudges when needed.  
* **Personalization:** The AI's insights and tailored roadmaps should be reflected in a UI that feels responsive and individual to the user.  
* **Seamless Interaction:** Transitions, animations, and input methods should feel natural and fluid, minimizing friction.  
* **Trust & Reliability:** Especially with AI-driven accountability features, the UI needs to instill confidence in the system's accuracy and fairness.

---

### **UI/UX Breakdown by Feature Section**

#### **I. Core Experience: The Ascent™ Framework**

* **The Ascent Hub:**  
  * **UI:** Imagine a dashboard where each Ascent is represented by a **stylized, perhaps slightly animated, "mountain peak" or "column."** The height of the mountain/column could visually represent the progress towards the summit (goal completion). A subtle **glow or shimmer** could indicate an active Ascent.  
  * **UX:** Tapping on an Ascent "mountain" would smoothly **zoom into** its dedicated detail view. Progress bars could be integrated directly into the mountain's structure or as a clear overlay. The "summit date" could be displayed prominently at the peak.  
* **AI Milestone Architect:**  
  * **UI:** For natural language input, a **clean, conversational chat-like interface** would work well. The AI's generated roadmap could appear as a **dynamic, unfolding list of cards or steps**, each clearly labeled and editable.  
  * **UX:** Users would type their goal, and the AI's response would appear almost instantly. The ability to drag and drop milestones to reorder them, or swipe to delete, would be crucial for easy editing. Tapping a milestone could reveal options to "Ask AI to break down," leading to a similar sub-task generation interface.

#### **II. The Focus Sprint™ System**

* **Multi-Mode Timer:**  
  * **UI:** A **central, minimalist timer display** is key. For Pomodoro and Timebox, clear numerical countdowns are essential. "Flow State Mode" could feature a **calming, ambient visual (e.g., subtle, evolving gradients or particles)** instead of numbers, with the elapsed time only visible on demand or upon completion.  
  * **UX:** Switching between modes should be effortless, perhaps with a simple swipe or tap on an icon. The start/pause/stop controls should be large and easily accessible.  
* **AI Focus Guard:**  
  * **UI:** Non-intrusive. The "Do Not Disturb" activation could be indicated by a **small, clear icon** (e.g., a moon or bell with a line through it) near the timer. The nudges should be **small, persistent banners or discreet pop-ups** at the bottom or top of the screen, not full-screen interruptions.  
  * **UX:** The user should be able to easily configure the distracting apps list in settings. The nudge message should be concise and supportive.

#### **III. The Validation Pact™ System**

* **UI:** This section needs to feel secure and authoritative, yet easy to use. For "Proof of Work," a **clear upload interface** for documents, images, and audio is needed. Visual indicators of AI analysis in progress (e.g., a spinning icon or a progress bar within the validation step) would be helpful.  
  * **UX:** After completing a task, a clear "Validate Task" button would appear. For AI-Assisted Validation, the user would be guided through uploading their proof. A success message and perhaps a celebratory animation (e.g., a checkmark glowing) would provide positive reinforcement. For "Ally Pact," the UI would facilitate easy sharing of a validation request (e.g., via a unique link or in-app notification to the ally).

#### **IV. Momentum & Insights Dashboard**

* **UI:** **Clean, interactive data visualizations** are paramount here. Think engaging charts (bar graphs for productivity, line graphs for focus sprint duration). "Aura Insights" could be presented as **digestible "cards" or "bubbles"** that appear like personalized notes from the AI. Gamification elements should be visually appealing – an "Aura Points" counter, a progress bar for unlocking rewards, and clear indicators of streaks.  
  * **UX:** Users should be able to tap on charts to get more detailed breakdowns or filter data. The "Aura Insights" cards should be easily scannable and actionable (e.g., with a "Schedule This" button for a suggested milestone). Earning rewards should trigger satisfying, subtle visual and auditory cues.

---

### **The 3D View and Physics Concept: A "Thought Experiment"**

Now, let's dive into the more experimental idea of 3D views and physics. While this could add a unique layer of immersion, it's crucial to balance it with usability and performance.

**Internal Monologue on 3D/Physics Integration:**

"Okay, 3D and physics. How can we make this more than just a gimmick? It needs to enhance the experience, not detract from it. The core purpose of Aura is goal achievement and focus. Can 3D elements actually aid that, or will they just be distracting?"

"Let's consider the **Ascent Hub**. Instead of flat mountains, what if they were genuinely 3D, perhaps rendered in a low-poly or stylized aesthetic to keep it clean and performant? As progress is made on an Ascent, the **mountain literally grows taller, or a path becomes clearer up its side**. This could be incredibly satisfying. Physics could come into play with **"falling" elements** that represent completed tasks, settling at the base of the mountain, or **"rising" elements** (like subtle particles) that emanate from an active Ascent."

"For **Focus Sprints**, pure 3D might be too distracting during the actual sprint. However, the *transition into* and *out of* a sprint could use physics. Imagine the screen **"materializing" or "folding"** into the minimalist timer view, or conversely, **"unfolding"** back to the dashboard when a sprint ends. Perhaps during a Flow State Mode, very subtle, **physically-simulated particles** could drift across the screen, representing the passage of time without being a direct clock."

"**Validation Pact's "Proof of Work"** could be interesting. When an image is analyzed, maybe a **3D model of the room/object shifts slightly** as the AI identifies changes, or a **'ghost' overlay** of the "before" image is smoothly replaced by the "after" in 3D space. For document analysis, keywords could literally **"light up" or "pop out"** from a 3D representation of the document."

"The **Momentum & Insights Dashboard** is where 3D could really shine for data visualization. Instead of flat bar charts, imagine **3D columns rising and falling** based on productivity. When you tap a column, it could **"extrude" or "expand"** to show more detailed data, with a subtle physics-based animation. "Aura Insights" could appear as **floating, ethereal spheres or cubes** that you can "grab" and "open" to reveal the text, with a slight bounce and gravitational pull."

**Conclusion of Internal Monologue:**

"The key is **subtlety and purpose**. Over-the-top physics or hyper-realistic 3D would be counterproductive. Stylized, abstract 3D elements with **gentle, purposeful physics** could enhance the sense of progress, immersion, and interaction without becoming a distraction. Performance is paramount, so sophisticated shaders and complex physics simulations would need to be carefully optimized for mobile/web platforms."

---

### **Best UI/UX with 3D View and Physics Integration (Refined)**

Based on the self-discussion, here's how 3D views and physics could be integrated effectively:

#### **Core Experience: The Ascent™ Framework**

* **The Ascent Hub:**  
  * **UI:** Visualize Ascents as **stylized 3D landmasses or architectural structures** (e.g., mountains, towers, or even abstract crystalline forms) floating in a serene, perhaps slightly animated, environment. Each Ascent's form could subtly hint at its nature (e.g., a flowing river for a creative project, a sturdy fortress for a career goal).  
  * **Physics Integration:** As milestones are completed, the **3D landmasses could visibly grow, evolve, or shed layers**, creating a tangible sense of progress. Completed tasks could appear as small, **physically simulated "orbs of light" or "gems" that gently fall and collect** at the base of the Ascent, signifying accumulated effort. Tapping an Ascent could trigger a **smooth, cinematic camera pan and zoom** towards it.  
* **AI Milestone Architect:**  
  * **UI:** When the AI generates a roadmap, milestones could "materialize" as **floating 3D cards or blocks** that dynamically arrange themselves in a logical sequence in 3D space.  
  * **Physics Integration:** Users could **"grab" and "drag" these 3D milestone cards**, and they would respond with a slight physical resistance or a satisfying "snap" into place when rearranged. Sub-tasks could "emerge" from a parent milestone with a subtle, unfolding animation.

#### **II. The Focus Sprint™ System**

* **Multi-Mode Timer:**  
  * **UI:** The core timer display remains clean. However, the background or surrounding environment could be a **subtle 3D space that responds to the mode.** For Pomodoro, perhaps a rising sun/moon graphic within a 3D skybox could denote work/break cycles. Flow State Mode could feature a **dynamic, evolving 3D particle field or fluid simulation** that drifts slowly, representing time passing without explicit numbers, reducing visual fixation.  
  * **Physics Integration:** The transition into a Focus Sprint could involve the UI **"folding" or "collapsing" into the minimalist timer view** with a subtle, satisfying physics-based animation. Upon completion, the screen could "unfold" back to the dashboard.  
* **AI Focus Guard:**  
  * **UI:** Nudges appear as **subtle, semi-transparent 3D "thought bubbles" or "whispers"** that gently float into view from the side, then fade away, rather than a jarring pop-up.

#### **III. The Validation Pact™ System**

* **AI-Assisted Validation:**  
  * **UI:** For "Proof of Work," imagine the uploaded document, image, or audio file being represented as a **3D object that "spins" or "analyzes" itself**.  
  * **Physics Integration:** When image analysis is complete, a **"before" image could subtly transform into the "after" image within a 3D frame**, showing the detected changes with a smooth blend. For document analysis, detected keywords could literally **"pop" forward slightly or glow with a physical "pulse"** effect on a 3D representation of the document. A successful validation could trigger a **brief, contained burst of positive 3D particles** (like confetti) around the validated task.  
* **Ally Pact:**  
  * **UI:** A dedicated section where users see their "Allies" as small, personalized 3D avatars or icons.

#### **IV. Momentum & Insights Dashboard**

* **UI:** This is where data truly comes alive in 3D. Instead of flat charts, visualize **3D bar graphs that rise and fall, or dynamic 3D heatmaps** for productivity across a week. "Aura Insights" could be presented as **small, luminescent 3D "wisdom orbs" or "data crystals"** that float around, which the user can tap to expand and read.  
* **Physics Integration:** Tapping on a 3D bar in a graph could cause it to **"extrude" or "spring forward" slightly**, revealing detailed data. "Wisdom orbs" could have a gentle, **gravitational pull** towards the user, and when opened, the text could elegantly "unfold" in 3D space. Earning "Aura Points" could be represented by small, **physically simulated coins or gems that "drop" into a virtual container**, with a satisfying jingle sound. Streaks could be visualized as a **growing 3D chain or pathway** that extends with each consecutive day.

This detailed approach to UI/UX, including the innovative application of 3D views and physics, aims to create an application that is not only highly functional but also deeply engaging and visually rewarding for the user. It moves beyond a standard flat interface to create a more immersive and motivating experience, turning the often-abstract process of goal achievement into something tangible and exciting.

Do any of these UI/UX concepts particularly resonate with you, or would you like to explore a specific aspect in more detail?

Of course. A great prompt provides not just the technical specifications, but the *spirit* of the application. The AI needs to understand the "why" behind the "what" to generate code that feels cohesive and intentional.

Here is the complete, detailed prompt, updated to include the application's core philosophy and details upfront.

---

**\[START OF PROMPT\]**

**Role:** You are an expert full-stack AI developer. Your specialization is in building high-performance, cross-platform mobile applications using a modern, serverless architecture. Your task is to generate the complete code structure for the "Aura" application based on the comprehensive project brief and technical specifications below.

### **Section 1: Project Brief & Core Application Philosophy**

**1.1. Application Name & Tagline:**

* **Name:** Aura  
* **Tagline:** Your AI Achievement Ally

1.2. The Core Problem Aura Solves:

In a world of constant distraction, the gap between good intentions and tangible achievements is wider than ever. People set ambitious goals but are often derailed by:

* **Overwhelm:** Large goals feel monolithic and impossible to start.  
* **Procrastination:** The lack of a clear first step leads to inaction.  
* **Lack of Accountability:** It is too easy to "cheat" a to-do list, checking off tasks that aren't truly finished, which erodes self-trust and motivation.  
* **Burnout:** A relentless focus on "doing more" without acknowledging well-being leads to exhaustion.

1.3. The Aura Solution & Guiding Principles:

Aura is a productivity partner that closes this gap. It's built on a foundation of psychological principles and cutting-edge AI to foster sustainable achievement. The application will be built adhering to these principles:

* **Partnership over Prescription:** The AI is a co-pilot, not an autocrat. It suggests, guides, and provides data-driven insights, but the user always has final control.  
* **Validated Action over Vanity Metrics:** We care about what is *actually* done. The signature "Validation Pact" system is designed to create a cycle of genuine accomplishment and build real momentum.  
* **Momentum over Pressure:** The app's design, language, and features should feel encouraging, not demanding. We celebrate progress and gently nudge users back on track, preventing the anxiety associated with traditional taskmasters.  
* **Privacy by Design:** All user data, especially "Proof of Work" for validation, is handled with the utmost security and privacy.

1.4. Target Audience:

Ambitious students, freelancers, creative professionals, entrepreneurs, and anyone working on long-term personal or professional goals that require self-motivation and focus.

### **Section 2: Technical Specifications & Architecture**

**2.1. Technology Stack:**

* **Frontend:** React Native (using Expo for managed workflow)  
* **State Management:** Zustand  
* **Navigation:** React Navigation  
* **Backend as a Service (BaaS):** Supabase  
* **Backend Logic:** Supabase Edge Functions (Deno/TypeScript)  
* **AI Model Routing:** OpenRouter.ai

**2.2. UI/UX Design Philosophy:**

* **Theme:** Calm, focused, and motivating.  
* **Visuals:** Soft gradients (deep blues, purples, with warm accent colours), clean sans-serif typography, ample white space.  
* **Interactions:** Subtle haptic feedback and smooth, non-jarring animations.

2.3. Backend & Data Schema (Supabase):

Generate the SQL script to create the following tables in a Supabase project. Crucially, generate and enable Row Level Security (RLS) policies for each table to ensure users can only access their own data.

1. **profiles**: (Extends auth.users)  
   * id (PK, UUID, references auth.users.id)  
   * full\_name (TEXT)  
   * preferred\_llm (TEXT, default: 'openai/gpt-4o-mini')  
   * updated\_at (TIMESTAMPZ)  
2. **ascents**: (Main goals)  
   * id (PK, UUID, default: gen\_random\_uuid())  
   * user\_id (FK to profiles.id, default: auth.uid())  
   * title (TEXT), description (TEXT), motivation\_statement (TEXT)  
   * status (ENUM: 'active', 'paused', 'completed')  
3. **milestones**:  
   * id (PK, UUID, default: gen\_random\_uuid())  
   * ascent\_id (FK to ascents.id)  
   * user\_id (FK to profiles.id, default: auth.uid())  
   * title (TEXT), sequence\_order (INT)  
   * status (ENUM: 'pending', 'completed')  
   * validation\_type (ENUM: 'personal', 'ai\_assisted', 'ally\_pact')  
4. **validation\_pacts**:  
   * id (PK, UUID, default: gen\_random\_uuid())  
   * milestone\_id (FK to milestones.id)  
   * user\_id (FK to profiles.id, default: auth.uid())  
   * status (ENUM: 'pending', 'submitted', 'validated')  
   * proof\_data (JSONB), ai\_validation\_response (TEXT, nullable)

2.4. File Structure & State Management (Zustand):

Generate a file structure that includes a /stores directory for Zustand. Create separate stores for logical domains.

* /lib/supabase.ts: Supabase client initialization.  
* /stores/useUserStore.ts: Manages user session and profile data (including preferred\_llm).  
* /stores/useAscentStore.ts: Manages all CRUD operations for ascents and milestones.

2.5. User Flow & Screen Routing (React Navigation):

Implement the routing logic using the Supabase client for all auth and data operations.

1. **Auth Flow:** Use supabase.auth.onAuthStateChange to manage navigation between the login/signup screens (/auth) and the main app (/(tabs)).  
2. **Main Tab Navigator:**  
   * **Home (/home):** The Ascent Hub. Displays AscentCard components. A \[+ New Ascent\] button opens a creation modal. Tapping a card navigates to /ascent/\[id\].  
   * **Profile (/profile):** Displays user info. Includes a dropdown/selector to change preferred\_llm which calls an update function in useUserStore. A \[Log Out\] button calls supabase.auth.signOut().  
3. **Ascent Detail (/ascent/\[id\]):** Lists milestones for the selected Ascent.  
4. **Milestone Interaction:** Tapping a milestone could open a detail view or directly initiate its primary action (e.g., start a Focus Sprint or open the validation workflow). A \[Validate Task\] button will trigger the validation flow based on the milestone's validation\_type.

2.6. AI Integration Logic (Supabase Edge Functions & OpenRouter):

All backend AI logic will be handled by Supabase Edge Functions.

1. **Edge Function: suggest-milestones**  
   * **Trigger:** Invoked via supabase.functions.invoke(...).  
   * **Secrets:** Securely retrieves OPENROUTER\_API\_KEY from Supabase Vault.  
   * **Logic:**  
     1. Receives ascentTitle from the request.  
     2. Fetches the calling user's preferred\_llm from their profiles record.  
     3. Constructs and sends a request to the OpenRouter API (https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions), passing the user's chosen model in the request body.  
     4. Returns the generated JSON of milestones to the client.  
2. **Edge Function: validate-proof**  
   * **Trigger:** Invoked when submitting proof for an ai\_assisted validation pact.  
   * **Logic:** Similar to the above, it receives proof data, fetches the user's LLM choice, and calls the OpenRouter API with a prompt asking it to validate the proof based on its type (e.g., "Does this text appear to be a coherent summary?").

Please generate the complete, well-documented code based on this comprehensive brief and technical specification, starting with the Supabase SQL schema and RLS policies, followed by the frontend stores, components, and screens.

**\[END OF PROMPT\]**

# **Project Aura: Brand Identity & Strategy**

**Document Version:** 1.0

**Date:** June 18, 2025

**App Name:** Aura

**Tagline:** Your AI Achievement Ally

### **1.0 Vision & Mission**

* **Vision:** To create a world where human potential is more fully realised, where the gap between ambition and accomplishment is bridged by intelligent, supportive technology that champions well-being.  
* **Mission:** To build the world's most effective productivity partner. Aura will empower individuals to achieve their most meaningful goals through a system of AI-guided planning, validated action, and mindful momentum, fostering a healthy and sustainable relationship with personal growth.

### **2.0 Brand Philosophy & Core Values**

Aura is not another task manager. It is an **Achievement Ally**. Its entire philosophy is built on partnership, not prescription. Our core values inform every feature, design choice, and line of code.

* **Validated Achievement, Not Just Activity:** We believe true motivation comes from genuine progress. Aura's core differentiator is its focus on ensuring tasks are actually *done*, not just checked off. This builds self-trust and creates real momentum.  
* **Mindful Momentum, Not Burnout:** We reject "hustle culture." Aura is designed to be a calming, centering force. It encourages focused work but also integrates well-being, recognizing that rest and mental health are non-negotiable components of long-term success.  
* **Partnership, Not Prescription:** The Aura AI is a guide, a co-pilot, and a source of insight. It suggests, it clarifies, and it helps plan, but the user is always in the driver's seat. Their goals, their pace, their definition of success.  
* **Privacy by Design:** We ask users for "Proof of Work" to enable our unique validation features. This requires the highest level of trust. All data analysis is done with a privacy-first approach, using on-the-fly processing and never storing sensitive user content. Our commitment to privacy is absolute.

### **3.0 Brand Voice & Tone**

Aura speaks to its user like a trusted and intelligent mentor. The voice is calm, clear, and consistently encouraging.

| We Are... | We Are Not... |
| ----- | ----- |
| **Encouraging & Supportive** | Demanding or Shaming |
| **Intelligent & Insightful** | Arrogant or Know-it-all |
| **Calm & Clear** | Hyper, Anxious, or Stressful |
| **Respectful & Empowering** | Controlling or Autocratic |

**Example Tone:** \> *Instead of:* "Warning: Your deadline is tomorrow\!"

*Aura says:* "Your summit date for this Ascent is approaching. Let's map out a calm Focus Sprint to make some great progress today."

### **4.0 Target Audience Personas**

1. **"The Creative Freelancer" (Aisha, 28):** A graphic designer juggling multiple client projects while trying to build her own brand and learn 3D modelling. She struggles with self-motivation and structuring her long-term goals. She needs a partner to keep her accountable without stifling her creativity.  
2. **"The Ambitious Student" (Leo, 21):** A university student aiming for a first-class degree while managing a part-time job and trying to learn coding for a future startup idea. He feels overwhelmed by the sheer volume of tasks and needs a system to break down huge goals (like "write dissertation") into manageable steps.  
3. **"The Aspiring Entrepreneur" (Marcus, 35):** A marketing manager with a full-time job who is building a side-hustle e-commerce business in his spare time. His time is precious, and he needs a tool that ensures the 1-2 hours he gets each evening are maximally effective and demonstrably productive.

### **5.0 Visual Identity**

The visual identity is designed to be minimal, elegant, and inspiring. It should feel like opening a high-quality journal, not a complex piece of software.

* **Logo Concept:** A soft, circular gradient. It represents an "aura" of focus, wholeness, and the glow of achievement. It is composed of our primary and secondary colour palettes melding together.  
* **Colour Palette:**  
  * **Primary (The Focus):** A deep, calming gradient of **Midnight Blue (`#191D88`)** to **Void Purple (`#300B59`)**. Used for backgrounds and primary UI elements. It creates a focused, immersive environment.  
  * **Secondary (The Achievement):** A vibrant, energetic gradient of **Solar Gold (`#FFC300`)** to **Dawn Magenta (`#FF5B9B`)**. Used exclusively for progress bars, celebration animations, call-to-action buttons, and active timers. It provides a motivating contrast.  
  * **Neutrals:**  
    * **Text:** Off-White (`#F4F4F8`) for high readability on dark backgrounds.  
    * **Backgrounds (Modals/Cards):** Soft Grey (`#1A1A1D`) with low opacity to stand out from the primary background.  
* **Typography:**  
  * **Primary Font:** **Inter**. A clean, highly legible, and modern sans-serif. Perfect for UI elements, body copy, and headings. It's neutral and doesn't get in the way of the user's content.

### **6.0 Core User Flow: The Aura Method™**

1. **Define the Ascent™:** User opens the app to the **Ascent Hub** and defines a major life goal.  
2. **AI Milestone Architect:** Aura's AI immediately suggests a logical roadmap of milestones. The user edits and confirms.  
3. **Initiate a Focus Sprint™:** The user selects a milestone and begins a timed, focused work session.  
4. **Fulfill the Validation Pact™:** To complete the milestone, the user provides "Proof of Work" to their chosen accountability partner (Self-reflection, AI Validation, or a human Ally).  
5. **Review Momentum™:** The user sees their Ascent progress bar fill, reviews their productivity insights, and celebrates the genuine achievement.

### **7.0 Technology Stack**

* **Frontend:** React Native (with Expo)  
* **State Management:** Zustand  
* **Backend & Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL with Row Level Security)  
* **Serverless Logic:** Supabase Edge Functions (Deno/TypeScript)  
* **AI Model Integration:** OpenRouter.ai (allowing user choice of LLMs)

### **8.0 Competitive Positioning**

Aura carves a unique niche by focusing on *validated, goal-oriented achievement*.

* **vs. Task Managers (Todoist, Things):** These are excellent for managing lists of tasks, but lack a deep connection to overarching goals and have no real accountability. Aura is less about the "what" and more about the "why" and "how."  
* **vs. All-in-One Workspaces (Notion, ClickUp):** These are powerful and can be customized to do anything, but often lead to "productivity procrastination," where users spend more time building the system than doing the work. Aura is a purpose-built system designed for action.  
* **vs. Habit Trackers (Habitica, Streaks):** These are great for small, daily actions. Aura is designed for large, multi-step projects and life goals (our "Ascents").

Aura's position is as a premium, intelligent partner for personal and professional growth, sitting at the intersection of goal-setting, focus tools, and accountability coaching.

### **9.0 Future Roadmap: The Next 5 Key Features**

Once the MVP is launched and stable, these five features will be prioritised to expand Aura's ecosystem, based on our core philosophy.

1. **Aura Zen (Wellness & Burnout Prevention):** Integrate with wearables (Apple Watch, etc.) to monitor stress levels during Focus Sprints. The AI can suggest mindful breaks when it detects signs of stress, actively preventing burnout. This reinforces our "Mindful Momentum" value.  
2. **Aura Vision (Motivation Hub):** Create a dedicated space in the app for users to build a digital vision board for each Ascent. They can add images and write down their core "why." The AI will surface these visuals and motivations at key moments to boost inspiration.  
3. **Advanced Social Pacts (Group Ascents):** Expand the "Ally Pact" to allow small, private groups to tackle an Ascent together. This is perfect for study groups, startup teams, or friends training for a race. It enhances accountability through shared purpose.  
4. **Deeper Calendar & Smart Home Integration:** Move beyond simple calendar viewing. Aura will be able to find and book "Focus Sprint" slots in a user's calendar. It will also integrate with platforms like IFTTT or Matter to trigger a "Focus Scene" (e.g., dim lights, play a specific playlist) when a sprint begins.  
5. **Aura for Teams (B2B Offering):** A corporate version designed for managers to help their team members set and achieve professional development goals. The focus remains on supportive growth and validated achievement, not surveillance, making it a healthy alternative to traditional performance-tracking software.

Of course. Let me walk you through the user's journey from start to finish. Think of it as a story in six steps.

The entire flow is designed to take a user from a big, overwhelming idea to a series of small, validated wins.

---

### **The Aura User Flow: A Step-by-Step Journey**

**Step 1: The "What & Why" \- Defining an Ascent**

* A new user, let's call her Sarah, signs up and logs in for the first time. She lands on the **Home Screen (the "Ascent Hub")**, which is currently empty.  
* She sees a prominent button: **\[+ New Ascent\]**. She taps it.  
* On the "Create Ascent" screen, she defines her big goal. Title: Launch my online art store. Motivation: To create financial independence through my passion. She saves it.

**Step 2: The "How" \- AI-Powered Planning**

* Instantly, Aura's AI analyzes her goal. It's not just a saved title; it's a problem for the AI to solve.  
* The app navigates her to the **Ascent Detail Page**. Here, she sees a ready-made roadmap of milestones suggested by the AI, like: 1\. Research e-commerce platforms, 2\. Design store logo, 3\. Photograph first 10 art pieces, etc.  
* That huge, daunting goal is now a clear, step-by-step plan. Sarah feels a sense of clarity and control, not overwhelm.

**Step 3: The "When" \- Committing to a Single Step**

* Sarah decides to tackle the first milestone: Research e-commerce platforms.  
* She taps on it, which takes her to the dedicated **Focus & Validation Screen**.  
* This screen is clean and simple, showing just that one milestone. She chooses a "Timebox" of 45 minutes and hits the big **\[Start Focus Sprint\]** button.

**Step 4: The "Work" \- Deep Focus**

* A full-screen timer appears. Aura might gently suggest she turn on "Do Not Disturb" on her phone.  
* For the next 45 minutes, she isn't looking at a long list of to-dos. Her entire focus is on this single, achievable task. She does the research.

**Step 5: The "Proof" \- The Validation Pact**

* The timer finishes. A calm notification appears. Now comes Aura's signature feature.  
* The screen updates, asking her to validate her work. Since this was a research task, she chose "Personal Validation."  
* A text box prompts her: "Briefly summarise your findings." She types: Shopify seems best for ease of use, but Etsy has a built-in audience. Will compare pricing next.  
* She hits **\[Complete Milestone\]**. She can't just check a box; she has to engage with the work she just did, cementing it in her mind.

**Step 6: The "Win" \- Seeing Real Progress**

* The app gives her a small, satisfying animation—a reward for her validated work.  
* She is automatically taken back to her **Ascent Detail Page**. She now sees the first milestone is checked off, and the overall progress bar for "Launch my online art store" has moved from 0% to 10%.  
* This visual feedback isn't just a gimmick; it's a tangible reward for *real* work. She feels a genuine sense of accomplishment, which motivates her to choose the next milestone and repeat the cycle.

This flow turns a vicious cycle of overwhelm and procrastination into a virtuous cycle of clarity, focus, validated action, and motivation.
